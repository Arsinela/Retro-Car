  <h1>Welcome to auto dealer website !</h1>

  <p>In the United States, a car dealership is a retailer that sells new and/or   used cars. Used car dealerships carry cars from many different manufacturers,   while new car dealerships are generally franchises associated with only one or   two manufacturers. However, in some areas, dealerships have been consolidated   and a single owner may control a chain of dealerships representing several   different manufacturers. New car dealerships also sell used cars, as they take   in trade-ins and/or purchase used vehicles at auction. Most dealerships also   provide a series of additional services for car buyers and owners, which are   sometimes more profitable than the core business of selling cars.</p>
  <p>Most car dealerships display their inventory in a showroom and on a car lot.   Under federal law, all new cars must carry a sticker showing the offering price   and summarizing the vehicle's features. Typically, salespersons working on   commission only, negotiate with buyers to determine a final sales price. In many   cases, this includes negotiating the price of a trade-in &mdash; the dealer's purchase   of the buyer's current automobile. Negotiations from the dealerhip's perspective   is often referred to as "desking" a deal.</p>
